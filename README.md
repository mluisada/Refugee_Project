# Refugee Project

Armed conflicts, non-respect of human rights, man-made or natural disasters have forced thousands of people to flee their homes and sometimes countries. The UN Refugee Agency estimates the number of displaced people to 65.6 million at the end of 2016 (Source: http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html).


## Why this project?
Looking back at the past - the most striking example which comes to my mind being World War II - millions of civilians were killed, displaced, families separated because of bombings, ethnic cleansing, political disagreements. When the war ended, there was a joined effort by citizens, countries and organizations to host these refugees, adopt orphan children and rebuild new homes. 

Reading stories of refugees (http://stories.unhcr.org), listening to Ted Talks (https://www.ted.com/talks/david_miliband_the_refugee_crisis_is_a_test_of_our_character/) has encouraged me to start this project.

## Goal
- Gather stories of refugees and show how they relate or differ. What are their main characteristics? Which feelings are the dominant ones?
- Use Twitter data to analyze media and people's perception of migrant crisis over time and geographically.
- Visualize migration flows
